Documentation
============================================================

I have started working on this bot a month ago and I made a lot of commands and it turned out successful.

I have decided to publish the bot to the public for people to test and use. I am willing to add more commands if Staric receives a lot of attention.

# Configuration

We are now done with the commands, this is the in-depth guide for how to configure settings in your server.

Let's see the `s!config` command first.

The config command lets you to change the channels where the modules should take place, example below.

![Testing config command](https://i.gyazo.com/d0006cf61e67936d2338ac249e13e307.gif)

To show the configurations of your server, simply type `s!config` without any arguments, example below.

![Testing config command](https://i.gyazo.com/ba80feaddc336992189a78f544d14d88.gif)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The configurations that you can change:

- Prefix. Key: `prefix`
- Announcement Channel. Key: `announcechannel`
- Log channel. Key: `logs`
- Welcome channel. Key: `welcomelog`
- Leave channel. Key: `leavelog`
- Modlogs channel. Key: `modlogs`

That's pretty much it, easy right?

# Modules

To change modules, you have to use two commands. `disable` and `enable`. From the name, `enable` enables modules while `disable` disable modules.

To disable/enable a module, check the example below.

![Testing enable/disable command](https://i.gyazo.com/85535aca8f377cd412e94e27e49967fc.gif)

You can't enable/disable a module that's already enabled/disabled, as it will error as example below.

![Testing enable/disable command](https://i.gyazo.com/627da9f10125c896dc04fe202b393b77.gif)

To show which modules that are disable/enabled, simply use the command `s!modules` as example below.

![Testing modules command](https://i.gyazo.com/24986b86fa7636c04d4cbf262e990194.gif)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here are the modules that you can enable/disable with description:

| Module | Description | Key |
|--|--|--|
| Logs | Logs for general stuff such as message edit, message delete, etc.  | logs |
|Mod logs| Logs for moderation stuff, such as warn, kick, ban, etc. | modlogs |
|Leave logs | Logs when someone leaves the server, example of this will be down. | leavelog |
| Welcome log | Logs when someone joins the server, example of this will be down. | welcomelog |
| Filter | Filters swear words from the server, if anyone swears the bot would delete the message. | filter |

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Leave and welcome logs:

When someone leaves the server, the bot will respond with a random message in the leavelogs channel as below:

![Leave log](https://i.gyazo.com/7a281e55d11ed77dcdeae03119329aca.png)

When someone joins the server, the bot will respond with a random message in the welcomelogs channel as below:
